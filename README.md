This repo is accepted by "International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics" (IF=4.4 2023.05)

Some files you may need(ckpt,json,datasets...):  https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ZraMbY8eEFKNHBgkz_RiUA(rxlq)

The "caption_eval" is also recommended to download in any other repo, cuz it noticed me some files is larger than 50MB and I am not sure it is uploaded successfully.

### Running:

The "visible.py" can visualize some video samples, so you can run first.

Please notice that we choose the videos in "MSR-VTT". So you should download the "./dataset/MSR-VTT/*", "dict2.pt" and "warm_up.pt".

Just run the visible.py and see what happened !

The code is some kind of mass cuz I tried many times in this experiment.

You can train your own model in MSVD and MSR-VTT, and we do not offer any pretrained models becuase of the mass version control...
